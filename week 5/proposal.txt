CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program (Raphael Daveal)

1. What is the title of your program?
   Nigerian Market Price Analyzer

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
   This program will help Nigerians, especially traders and consumers, 
   track and analyze commodity prices across different markets. It will 
   provide insights into price trends, identify the cheapest or most expensive 
   markets, and help users make informed buying or selling decisions.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
   I will learn how to work with CSV datasets in Python, data analysis and 
   visualization using Python libraries, how to build interactive dashboards 
   with Streamlit, and how to apply Python functions to organize code, calculate 
   statistics, and summarize data.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
   I will use csv for reading and processing datasets, pandas for data analysis 
   and manipulation, datetime for handling dates, streamlit for building an 
   interactive dashboard, and matplotlib for visualizations.

5. List the names of functions you will need?
   a. read_market_data(filename)
   b. calculate_statistics(data)
   c. filter_by_market(data, market_name)
   d. plot_price_trends(data, commodity_name)
   e. display_dashboard(data)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
   a. test_read_market_data()
   b. test_calculate_statistics()
   c. test_filter_by_market()
   d. test_plot_price_trends()
